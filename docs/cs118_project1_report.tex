\section{Introduction}

This project looks to perform analysis of image characteristics using a Convolutional
Neural Network in order to identify specific image features. This report will explore the datasets used
for testing and their composition. It will also examine the different techniques explored and implemented for
attempting to identify specific image features from a set of images.

The approach for using these techniques will be examined as will proposals for further work on this topic.

\section{Dataset Overview}

An overview of the datasets used in this project will be presented as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dataset Contents
  \item Dataset Origins
  \item Relevance to Project
\end{enumerate}
